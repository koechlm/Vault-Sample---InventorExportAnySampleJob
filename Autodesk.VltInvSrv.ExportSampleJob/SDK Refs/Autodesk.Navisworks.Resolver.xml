      <summary>
            Used to allow Navisworks .NET Control solutions to bind to a particular Navisworks Runtime.
            If successful it returns the runtime that was actually bound to, otherwise null. Once succeeded
            the method will aways return the original binding.
            This must be called before any attempt is to load any other Navisworks Assemblies, including  
            Autodesk.Navisworks.Controls and Autodesk.Navisworks.Api.
